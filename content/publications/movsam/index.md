abstract: "MovSAM performs moving-object segmentation from a single image, where temporal motion cues are unavailable. A multimodal large language model reasons about the scene and produces textual object prompts; these are fused with visual representations from SAM and a vision-language model, then refined through an iterative reasoning loop."
summary: "Single-image moving-object segmentation through multimodal reasoning, language-guided prompting, and iterative refinement."

MovSAM asks whether motion can be inferred from scene semantics when only one image is available. It combines deliberate multimodal reasoning with foundation-model features to identify and refine moving-object masks without relying on a frame sequence.
